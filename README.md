# Requiem-for-the-Postman
A physics game where you sort letters and try not to die of thirst whilst navigating the Chinese dictionary and having to endure your boss's persisent phone calls. 

The theme of the competition was **running out of space**, and I took that literally: your in-game mail-sorting desk slowly fills up with large and uncomfortable dictionaries as you progress through the levels. Check out the [ldjam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/requiem-for-the-postman) page for screenshots.

Ranked 25th (out of hundreds) in the humour category. I don't enter Ludum Dare for recognition, but I like the fact that others enjoyed this one. It's nice and simple, and it was one of the most fun projects I've ever done. Made for Ludum Dare 42.
